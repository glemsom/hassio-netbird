NetBird is a simple and fast alternative to corporate VPNs built on top of WireGuardÂ® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home. It requires near zero configuration effort leaving behind the hassle of opening ports, complex firewall rules, vpn gateways, and so forth.

There is no centralized VPN server with NetBird - your computers, devices, machines, and servers connect to each other directly over a fast encrypted tunnel. NetBird can connect machines running anywhere in just a few clicks. It literally takes less than 5 minutes to deploy a secure peer-to-peer VPN with NetBird.

See [NetBird website][netbird-website] for further details.
